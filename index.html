          In this article, we will talk about the relationship between
          Electromotive force (EMF) and the temperature on Daniel’s cell
          solutions. <br />
          In other words, Why with increasing temperature the voltage decrease?
        </p>

        <h3>Why with increasing temperature the voltage decreases?</h3>
        <p>
          It's a common thing to think about the relationship between E(cell)
          and temperature since it’s an experiment in the physical chemistry
          lab, so what’s happening in this experiment and why?
        </p>

        <p>
          In this experiment, you have to prepare daniel’s cell ( galvanic cell
          ) or build it and it’s simple to do that grab two beakers then cathode
          and anode, so in our cell, it will be ( copper and zinc ) respectively
          and put them in the beakers where we already put them there ions
          solutions and a salt bridge (KCL ) between them ( CuSo4, ZnSo4 ) , (
          Cu+2, Zn+2 ) then connect both the cathode and anode with a the wire
          then put a galvanometer on the wire to measure the electromotive force
          ( EMF ) or E(cell) between the cathode and anode while the solutions
          beakers in a thermostat that increase the temperature on the cell
          solutions with time and see what happens to the E(cell) values.
        </p>

        <h3>Daniel’s cell ( galvanic cell ):</h3>

        </div>

        <p class="description">
          After the experimental measurements on our cell, we can plot them in
          the diagram and we will have these results:
        </p>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="./images/diagram.png" alt="daniel-cell" />
        </div>

        <p>
          As we see from the diagram the slope in the equation has a negative
          value so now we know that it’s an inverse relation between E(cell) and
          T (kᵒ).
        </p>

        <p>
          So now we know how to build a galvanic cell and what kind of relations
          between E(cell) and T (kᵒ) so now we ask ourselves why is it inverse?
        </p>

        <p>
          First, from experiment values we can find Gibbs free energy and
          enthalpy using these equations : Gibbs free energy: ∆G=-n F E Where :
        </p>

        <p>
          n: Number of moles <br />
          F: Faraday’s constant <br />
          E: Electromotive force
        </p>

        <p>Enthalpy: ∆H = -nFE-nFT (-∆E/∆T) Slope of diagram = ∆E/∆T</p>

        <p>
          And in the end, we will rise the temperature and get a negative value
          for both of them and now we should know that our reaction is
          (spontaneous and exothermic) so with increasing temperature our
          reaction will shift to lift towards the reactant in our
          oxidation-reduction reaction so the reaction won’t go well and it will
          reduce the electromotive force in our galvanic cell.
        </p>

        <p>
          And now let’s see the reason why it’s an inverse relation between EMF
          and T(kᵒ) at the ionic or atomic level and you can say that the reason
          is:
        </p>

        <p>
          Because in our Galvanic cell we got zinc and copper they connected to
          each other with a wire so the electrons move from the anode (Zinc) to
          cathode (copper) because copper pulls electrons more than zinc so it
          takes electrons from zinc by the connected wire between them and
          that's the electricity (movement of electrons) so when electrons go to
          copper metal, the copper ions will be in a copper sulfate solution so
          we got a free ion of copper (Cu+2) in our solution and when these
          electrons go to copper metal it gives them to the copper ions in the
          solution and become neutral so it sticks to copper metal it will
          increase the size (notice the size difference of the cathode between
          the beginning and the end of the experiment) and that happens in the
          room temperature (normal case) but when we increase the temperature of
          the cell solutions and as we know that our reaction is spontaneous and
          exothermic from the entropy and enthalpy experimental values (negative
          values) so now we know that's the energy that came from temperature
          goes to the ions in the solution and it gains a spontaneous movement
          energy a (kinetic energy) and start to hit the walls of the container
          away from the metal so our ions became two parts, one that gains
          energy and move away from metal so it will be distributed from it’s
          the main job (take electrons from metal and become a neutral) and it
          doesn’t take any electrons from the metal, and the other goes towards
          metal and gains electrons to become neutral and continue the electron
          movement between the cathode and anode so with increasing temperature
          the number of ions that goes away from metal is increasing and the
          usage of electrons than have been pulled from zinc to copper metal
          will decrease because the copper metal starts to become richer than
          zinc electrons that have been pulled and it will decrease the pull of
          electrons so the motion of electrons in the wire will decrease and the
          voltage will decrease as increasing of temperature because the voltage
          E(cell) is the electron movement in the wire.
