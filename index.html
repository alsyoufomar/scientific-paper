          In this article we will discuss the relationship between electromotive
          force (EMF) and the temperature in Daniel's cell solutions. <br />
          In other words: Why does the voltage decrease with increasing
          temperature?

          It is common to think about the relationship between E(cell) and
          temperature, since it is an experiment in the physical chemistry
          Laboratory. <br />
          So what happens in this experiment and why?
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
          In this experiment you have to prepare Daniel's cell (galvanic cell),
          and this is quite simple: you take two beakers, a cathode and anode,
          and in our cell it will be (copper and zinc) so now put them into the
          beakers, where we have already put ions solutions (CuSo4, ZnSo4),
          (Cu+2, Zn+2) and a salt bridge containing (KCL) between the beakers,
          then connect the cathode and the anode with a wire then place a
          galvanometer on the wire to measure the electromotive force (EMF) the
          movement of electrons between cathode and anode or the E(cell) between
          the cathode and the anode, while placing the solutions beakers in a
          thermostat that raises the temperature of the cell solutions so it
          will be warmed over time to see what happens to the E(cell) values.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in description">
          After the experimental measurements on our cell, we can plot them in
          the diagram and we get these results:
        </p>

        <div class="image fade-in">
          <img src="./images/diagram.png" alt="daniel-cell" />
        </div>

        <p class="fade-in">
          As we can see in the diagram, the slope in the equation has a negative
          value, so now we know that it is an inverse relationship between
          E(cell) and T(kᵒ).
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
          So now we know how to build a galvanic cell and what kind of
          relationships between E(cell) and T (kᵒ). Now we ask ourselves, why is
          the relationship inverse?
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
          First of all, from the experimental values we can calculate the Gibbs
          free energy and enthalpy from the experimental values using these
          equations: Gibbs free energy: ∆G=-n F E <br />
          Where:
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
          n: Number of moles <br />
          F: Faraday’s constant <br />
          E: Electromotive force
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
          Enthalpy: ∆H = -nFE-nFT (-∆E/∆T) Slope of diagram = ∆E/∆T
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
          In the end, we will raise the temperature and get a negative values
          for both of them and now we should know that our reaction is
          (spontaneous and exothermic), so that as the temperature increases,
          our reaction will move towards the reactant (shift to left ) in our
          oxidation-reduction reaction, so that the reaction will not proceed
          well and the electromotive force will be reduced in our galvanic cell.
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
          Now let’s see the reason why it’s an inverse relation between EMF and
          T(kᵒ) at the ionic or atomic level and you can say that the reason is:
        </p>

        <p class="fade-in">
          In our galvanic cell, we have zinc and copper connected by a wire, so
          the electrons move from the anode (zinc) to the cathode (copper)
          because copper attracts the electrons more than zinc, so it takes
          electrons from zinc through the wire between them, and that's the
          voltage of cell (movement of electrons), so when electrons go to the
          copper metal, the free copper ions (Cu+2) actually in our copper
          sulfate solution, so we have a free copper ion in our solution, and
          when these electrons go to the copper metal, it gives them to the
          copper ions from It’s solution and becomes neutral, so it sticks to
          the copper metal and becomes neutral so it increases the size of the
          metal (notice the difference in size of the cathode between the
          beginning and the ending of the experiment), and this happens at room
          temperature (normal case), but when we increase the temperature of the
          cell solutions and we know that our reaction is spontaneous and
          exothermic, as can be seen from the experimental values of Gibbs-free
          energy and enthalpy (negative values), then we now know that the
          energy coming from the temperature goes to the ions in the solution
          and they gain a spontaneous kinetic energy and start banging against
          the walls of the container, away from the metal, so our ions become
          two parts, one that gains energy and moves away from the metal, so it
          is freed from its main task (taking electrons from the metal and
          becoming a neutral) and does not take electrons from the metal, And
          the other part goes to the metal and work fine, That’s why it
          continues the movement of electron in the wire, So as the temperature
          increases, the number of ions moving away from the metal increases too
          and the use of electrons pulled from the zinc to the copper metal
          decreases as the increasing of copper ions that’s freed from its main
          task, So the copper metal becomes electron rich because there’s no
          large number of ions as the begging of the reaction that takes
          electrons from the copper metal so there will be decreasing of
          electrons that were pulled from zinc and the electron pull decreases
          so the movement of electrons in the wire decreases and the voltage
          decreases as the temperature increases because the voltage E(cell) is
          the electron movement in the wire.
