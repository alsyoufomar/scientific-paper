          In this article we will discuss the relationship between electromotive
          force (EMF) and the temperature in Daniel's cell solutions. <br />
          In other words: Why does the voltage decrease with increasing
          temperature?
        </p>

        <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Be familiar with the working mechanism of the galvanic cell</li>
          <li>How a balanced equation works</li>
          <li>The oxidation-reduction reaction</li>
          <li>How exothermy affects the reaction</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why does the voltage decrease with increasing temperature?</h3>
        <p>
          It is common to think about the relationship between E(cell) and
          temperature, since it is an experiment in the physical chemistry
          Laboratory. So what happens in this experiment and why?
        </p>

        <p>
          In this experiment you have to prepare Daniel's cell ( galvanic cell
          ), and this is quite simple: you take two beakers, a cathode and
          anode, so in our cell it will be ( copper and zinc ) and put them into
          the beakers, where we have already put ions in solutions and a salt
          bridge (KCL) between them ( CuSo4, ZnSo4 ), ( Cu+2, Zn+2 ), then
          connect the cathode and the anode with a wire then place a
          galvanometer on the wire to measure the electromotive force ( EMF ) or
          measure E(cell) between the cathode and the anode, while placing the
          solutionsPlace beakers in a thermostat that raises the temperature of
          the cellThe solutions are warmed over time to see what happens to the
          E(cell) values.

          After the experimental measurements on our cell, we can plot them in
          the diagram and we get these results:
        </p>

        <div class="image">
          <img src="./images/diagram.png" alt="daniel-cell" />
        </div>

        <p>
          As we can see in the diagram, the slope in the equation has a negative
          value, so we now know that it is an inverse relationship between
          E(cell) and T(kᵒ).
        </p>

        <p>
          So now we know how to build a galvanic cell and what kind of
          relationships between E(cell) and T (kᵒ). Now we ask ourselves, why is
          it the other way round?
        </p>

        <p>
          First of all, from the experimental values we can calculate the Gibbs
          free energy and enthalpy from the experimental values using these
          equations: Gibbs free energy: ∆G=-n F E Wo:
        </p>

        <p>
          n: Number of moles <br />
          F: Faraday’s constant <br />
          E: Electromotive force
        </p>

        <p>Enthalpy: ∆H = -nFE-nFT (-∆E/∆T) Slope of diagram = ∆E/∆T</p>

        <p>
          In the end, we will raise the temperature and get a negative value for
          and we should now know that our reaction is (spontaneous and
          exothermic). and exothermic), so that as the temperature increases,
          our reaction will move towards the reactant in our oxidation-reduction
          reaction, sothat the reaction will not proceed well and the
          electromotive force in our galvanic cell.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now let’s see the reason why it’s an inverse relation between EMF and
          T(kᵒ) at the ionic or atomic level and you can say that the reason is:
        </p>

        <p>
          In our galvanic cell, we have zinc and copper connected by a wire, so
          the electrons move from the anode (zinc) to the cathode (copper)
          because copper attracts more electrons than zinc, so it takes
          electrons from zinc through the wire between them, and that's the
          electricity (movement of electrons), so when electrons go to the
          copper metal, the copper ions are in a copper sulfate solution, so we
          have a free copper ion (Cu+2) in our solution, and when these
          electrons go to the copper metal, it gives them to the copper ions in
          the solution and becomes neutral, so it sticks to the copper metal and
          increases (note the difference in size of the cathode between the
          beginning and the end of the experiment), and this happens at room
          temperature (normal case), but when we increase the temperature of the
          cell solutions and we know that our reaction is spontaneous and
          exothermic, as can be seen from the experimental values of entropy and
          enthalpy (negative values), then we now know that the energy coming
          from the temperature goes to the ions in the solution and they gain a
          spontaneous kinetic energy and start banging against the walls of the
          container, away from the metal, so our ions become two parts, one that
          gains energy and moves away from the metal, so it is freed from its
          main task (taking electrons from the metal and becoming a neutral) and
          does not take electrons from the metal, As the temperature increases,
          the number of ions moving away from the metal increases and the use of
          electrons pulled from the zinc to the copper metal decreases as the
          copper metal becomes richer than the zinc electrons that were pulled
          and the electron pull decreases so the movement of electrons in the
          wire decreases and the voltage decreases as the temperature increases
          because the voltage E(cell) is the electron movement in the wire.
